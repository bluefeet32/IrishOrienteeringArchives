# Data

Data was collected from a few sources:
 - results on http://orienteering.ie & https://www.niorienteering.org.uk/
 - Past champions page at https://www.orienteering.ie/high-performance/past-irish-champions/
 - Spreadsheets maintained by Marcus Pinker

## Data generation

A spreadhseet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vPK1cAg3593l2pNEJpgtBBVHGx8LP-Q7mSgFKXT5FrY/edit?usp=sharing was used to generate the json data and can be used to generate other years which are missing. This also serves as a backup of the data outside of github.

As of 2025/04/04 data collection is ongoing.

## Data quality

Recent results are very reliable (2007 & later), and can be found on http://orienteering.ie. Older results are more challenging and in some cases this may be the only digital copy of them.
