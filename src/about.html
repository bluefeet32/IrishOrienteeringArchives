        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>Data was collected from a few sources:
            <li>results on <a href="http://orienteering.ie">orienteering.ie</a> & <a
                    href="https://www.niorienteering.org.uk/">www.niorienteering.org.uk</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.orienteering.ie/high-performance/past-irish-champions/">Past champions</a> page on
                o.ie</li>
            <li>Spreadsheets maintained by Marcus Pinker</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Data generation</h2>
        <p>A <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vPK1cAg3593l2pNEJpgtBBVHGx8LP-Q7mSgFKXT5FrY/edit?usp=sharing">spreadhseet</a>
            was
            used to generate the json data and can be used to generate other years which are missing. This also serves
            as a backup of the data outside of github.

            As of 2025/04/04 data collection is ongoing.
        </p>

        <h2>Data quality</h2>
        <p>
            Recent results are very reliable (2007 & later), and can be found on <a
                href="http://orienteering.ie">orienteering.ie</a>. Older results
            are more challenging and in some cases this may be the only digital copy of them.

        <h3>Known missing data</h3>
        First names of many old results are missing, I would appreciate input into these.

        If you have more info on data from the below years it would be greatly appreciated. The top 3 is mostly present
        in individual races.

        All detailed relay results before 1999 are missing, except 1984.

        In some cases I have first place
        <li>2006: Middle, Long times</li>
        <li>2005: All races (M, L, R)</li>
        <li>2004: All races (L, R)</li>
        <li>2003: All races (L, R)</li>
        <li>2002: All races (L, R)</li>
        <li>2001: All races (L, R)</li>
        <li>1997</li>
        <li>1996</li>
        <li>1995</li>
        <li>1994</li>
        <li>1993</li>
        <li>1992</li>
        <li>1991</li>
        <li>1990</li>
        <li>1989</li>
        <li>1988</li>
        <li>1987</li>
        <li>1986</li>
        <li>1985</li>
        <li>1979</li>
        <li>1976</li>

        I don't believe there was anything before 1975 (orienteering Ireland was founded in 1970).
